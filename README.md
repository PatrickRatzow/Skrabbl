# Requirements

You need at least version 12 of Node.js installed, but preferably the newest LTS version.

# API

To run the API server you'll need the Web application running as the API uses the web app as a proxy.

To install the web application open a terminal in the Skrabbl.Web directory and then run these commands
```bash
npm i -g @vue/cli-service
npm i
npm run serve
```

Wait for the web application to startup, and then startup the API.
